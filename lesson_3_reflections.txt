When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you need to share

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	In case you want to work on something without syncing with master

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Forks: copies inside Github
	Clones: local or remote copies of repositories
	Branches: diversions of commits

	It depends on the situation. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

	Don't really know. Would be harder without git or github, of course.
